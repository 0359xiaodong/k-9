* save fewer drafts

* Set -NONE- as drafts folder creates a folder called -NONE-
* moving messages from unsyncced folders is busted
* DELETE DRAFTS WHEN YOU ARE DONE SENDING
* the top of the screen displays "Search results /" when in the Unified Inbox. I can understand why that is, but it is confusing. And the "All messages" display shows exactly the same thing,
* select text menu option doesn't work in the unified inbox
* When in a message and i switch to landscape or pack i'm sent to the inbox again
